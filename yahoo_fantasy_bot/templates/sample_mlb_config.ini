# - MLB use .mlb
# - NHL use .nhl
builderModule=.mlb
# The class loader is a function that produces a class for the prediction
# builder.  It takes two arguments: yahoo_fantasy_api.League object and
# configparser.  The prediction builder object has one API that must exist:
# predict().  The first positional argument must be a roster.Container object.
# The remaining arguments are all named and are dependent on the
# PredictionNamedArguments section below.

# List the source of the predicted stats.  Valid options are:
# - 'yahoo' meaning we will use the current season stats
# - 'yahoo_lastseason' meaning we will use the stats from last season
# - 'yahoo_lastmonth' means we will use the stats for the last month
# - 'csv' means we will get the predicted stats from an external .csv file

#  - a ScoreComparer object
#  - a roster.Builder object
#  - a DataFrame of all of the players eligible to be included in the lineup
#  - list of players that form the initial lineup
